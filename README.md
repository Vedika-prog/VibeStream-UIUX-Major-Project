🎵 VibeStream – Mood-Based Seasonal Music App
UI/UX Major Project (2026)
📌 Project Overview

VibeStream is a mood-driven, season-inspired music streaming application designed as a Major UI/UX academic project. The goal of this project was to create a visually calming yet emotionally dynamic music experience that adapts to both user mood and seasonal themes.

The application was designed entirely in Figma using a component-based design system, structured layouts, and interactive prototyping. The primary focus of this project was to demonstrate strong understanding of UI principles, reusable components, visual hierarchy, auto layout, interactive transitions, and scalable design systems.

Rather than designing a static interface, this project explores how visual themes and emotional states can influence digital music experiences.

🎯 Design Vision & Concept

The core idea behind VibeStream is simple:

"Music should feel like the season you're in and match the mood you're experiencing."

Instead of presenting music in a generic way, VibeStream introduces:

🌦 A Seasonal Theme System
🎭 A Mood-Based Recommendation System
🌸 A soft, warm beige base UI for visual comfort
The interface adapts visually depending on the selected season while keeping the overall design cohesive and consistent.

📱 Designed Screens

The project includes three primary screens as required for submission:

1️⃣ Onboarding Screen

The onboarding screen was designed to create a premium and calming first impression.
It includes:
Centered brand logo
Minimal typography
Soft warm-beige background
Smooth entry animation
Clear "Get Started" call-to-action

The goal of this screen is to introduce the user to the app’s emotional and seasonal concept without overwhelming them with information.

2️⃣ Sign Up / Login Screen

The authentication screen focuses on clean form design and interaction clarity.

Key features include:
Soft card-based layout
Reusable input components
Focus and error state variants
Password visibility toggle
Smart Animate transitions between login and sign-up states
Clean spacing and visual balance

Rather than creating separate layouts for login and sign-up, variants were used to demonstrate efficient component reuse and structured UI logic.

3️⃣ Home Screen

The Home screen is the core of the application and demonstrates the full design system in action.

It includes:
Personalized greeting section
Seasonal theme selector
Interactive search state
Mood selection chips
Horizontally scrollable album cards
“Calm Rain Picks” dynamic playlist section
“Recently Played” section
“Trending For You” section
Fixed header
Fixed bottom navigation bar
Vertical and horizontal scrolling behavior

The layout was built using nested Auto Layout structures to ensure scalability and clean spacing logic.

🌈 Seasonal Theme System

One of the main highlights of this project is the seasonal color system.
The app supports five distinct seasonal modes:

🌧 Rain
☀️ Summer
❄️ Winter
🌸 Spring
🍂 Autumn

Each seasonal mode changes:

Accent color, Highlight backgrounds, Selected chip state, Emphasis tones in the UI

Despite color variation, the structure, spacing, and component hierarchy remain consistent across all versions. This demonstrates scalable system thinking instead of isolated screen design.

🎭 Mood-Based Interaction

In addition to seasons, VibeStream includes mood-based interaction.

Three of the five mood states were demonstrated:

Calm
Focus
Energetic

Mood selection updates:
Active chip state
Playlist section title
Accent emphasis

This showcases how content presentation can shift subtly without disrupting the overall interface.

🧩 Design System & Technical Implementation

This project emphasizes structured UI architecture. Key design system features include:
Auto Layout for scalable spacing
Nested layout containers
Reusable components
Variants (Default / Selected / Focus states)
Instance swap properties for navigation icons
Fixed positioning for header and navigation
Smart Animate transitions
Interactive prototype navigation
Vertical and horizontal scroll behavior

The system was designed to be extendable without requiring layout restructuring.

🔍 Interactive Prototype Flow

The prototype includes:

Onboarding → Authentication → Home flow
Seasonal switching interactions
Mood switching demonstration
Search activation state
Navigation bar state switching
Smart animated transitions

The prototype simulates real app behavior while maintaining clarity and simplicity.

🎨 Visual Design Language

Primary font: Poppins
Base color: Warm beige (reduced eye strain)
Style direction: Friendly, soft, calming
Icon style: Minimal line icons
Rounded corners for visual softness
Balanced negative space
Subtle shadows for depth

The goal was to avoid harsh whites and heavy contrasts, creating a relaxed visual environment.
